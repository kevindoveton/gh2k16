# EventSA #

South Australia is known as the festival state, however many of our citizens do not attend the many events that happen each week as they are unaware of them.

EventSA aims to showcase the best events happening in Adelaide, these events are sorted into category allowing users to find the events that appeal most to them. Users are also able to search in order to find new events.

By providing information on the parking closest to different events, eventSA is able to remove the stress of finding a park in the city. As well as supporting, council operated uPark, enabling the council to put more money into helping young performers put on breathtaking performances. 

Each event has a detailed view which contains pricing information, as well as the date of the event and the forecasted weather for the day. This enables our users to be completely informed and encourage them to explore the best events that Adelaide has to offer.

Our app combines data from the Australian Bureau of Metreology, UPark, and the Adelaide Council’s Events dataset. These are all updated in real time to ensure that our users are kept up to the date with the latest information. 

In the future we plan to monetize our app by providing small business’ and cafes near popular events the opportunity to embed small advertisements that would appeal to users attending.

We also plan to Integrate real time data provided from public transport to encourage users to catch public transport.
